        <h1>Pastor tacos</h1><br>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I have had great success preparing tacos this way. I bought this recipe from a taqueria owner (taco restaurant) in Mexico City. I am translating the directions. It can be used for beef, pork, or just about any other type of meat. The spice mix on this recipe gives meat a really excellent flavor.</p>

            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                  Place 1/2 chopped onion, 2 cloves garlic, parsley, oregano, paprika, anise seed, black pepper, cumin, sage, thyme, bay leaves, cloves, soy sauce, vinegar, orange juice, and lime juice in a blender; pulse until a very well-blended paste is achieved, scraping down sides as needed, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread paste on both sides of the flank steak. Wrap steak in plastic and refrigerate at least 6 hours to overnight.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove excess marinade from flank steak.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Grill steak until it begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Chop steak into small pieces and transfer to a platter; cover and keep warm until ready to serve.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Place 1 chopped onion, tomatoes, chipotle peppers, and 3 cloves garlic in a blender; pulse until desired consistency. Add water if the salsa becomes too thick. Transfer salsa to a bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Heat tortillas on a microwave safe plate until warm, about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Serve beef over stacks of two corn tortillas with salsa and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 chopped onion, radishes, and cilantro.
                </li>
              </ol>
